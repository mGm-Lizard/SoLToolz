You do not need to add this package to your ServerPackages list. You do, however, need to add it to your server's voting GameConfig.
If you want the WhoIs function to work correctly, you must install ClanManager on your server as well. ClanManager will be included with SoLTooLz.

Almost all features are available in the right-click context menu
